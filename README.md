# Natural Language Processing with Transformers – Hands-On

This repository contains hands-on implementations and experiments inspired by the book  
**"Natural Language Processing with Transformers"**.

Each chapter focuses on practical applications of transformer-based models, implemented through Jupyter notebooks to reinforce core NLP concepts and real-world workflows.

## 🔧 Tech Stack
- 🤗 Hugging Face Transformers
- PyTorch
- TensorFlow
- Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Contents
- Tokenization and embeddings
- Fine-tuning transformer models
- Text classification, NER, and sequence labeling
- Transfer learning with pretrained models
- Model evaluation and inference

## 🎯 Goal
To build a strong practical understanding of modern NLP using transformers by combining theory with hands-on experimentation.

## 🚀 Notes
- Code is written for learning and experimentation.
- Notebooks are updated chapter-wise as progress continues.
